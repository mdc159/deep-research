# Task List for Verifying `o1-mini` Model Call Through OpenRouter

## Openrouter API Key and Correct COnfiguration

- The code below is the correct way to call the o1-mini model through openrouter.
- o1-mini should be the default model used in the application.

    import requests
    import json

    response = requests.post(
    url="<https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions>",
    headers={
        "Authorization": "Bearer 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",
        "HTTP-Referer": "<YOUR_SITE_URL>", # Optional. Site URL for rankings on openrouter.ai.
        "X-Title": "<YOUR_SITE_NAME>", # Optional. Site title for rankings on openrouter.ai.
    },
    data=json.dumps({
        "model": "openai/o1-mini", # Optional
        "messages": [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "What is the meaning of life?"
        }
        ]
    })
    )

    print(response.json())

## Task 1: Verify Environment Variable Setup

- [x] Open `.env.local` in the IDE.
- [x] Confirm the `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` variable is defined and set to the correct API key value:

   ```env
   OPENROUTER_API_KEY=<Your_API_Key>
   ```

## Task 2: Confirm createOpenAI Configuration

- [x] Open the `providers.ts` file.
- [x] Check that the `createOpenAI` function is correctly initialized with process.env.OPENROUTER_API_KEY.
- [x] Verify that there are no lingering references to `OPENAI_KEY`.

## Task 3: Test o1-mini Model

- [x] In providers.ts, ensure the openai function is calling the o1-mini model with correct configuration
- [x] Add logging to confirm the API response
- [x] Created test-openrouter.ts for configuration testing

## Task 4: Update and Test run.ts

- [ ] Execute the script to verify the o1-mini model is working correctly
- [ ] Check the console output for the test prompt response
- [ ] Document any errors or issues encountered

## Task 5: Testing Steps

1. Run the test script:

   ```bash
   tsx src/test-openrouter.ts
   ```

2. If successful, run the main application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. Document any errors in debug.md

## Additional Notes

- Proxy wrapper is implemented correctly with provider and id handling
- OpenRouter configuration includes required headers
- Model configuration uses structured outputs as required
